# Simple-Subtitle-Renamer
A very simple subtitle renamer written in C++17, using filesystem. 
This program renames first n subtitle files to the title of the first m video files(if n is not equal to m, it renames till the smaller number items). Usually useful to rename all the subtitles of a series downloaded as a zip to the local name of the corresponding video files.
Change the file extensions or path of the folder to work on in the main.cpp file and compile using C++17 compiler.
